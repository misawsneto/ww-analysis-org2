//! PTY (Pseudo-Terminal) Module
//!
//! Provides integrated terminal functionality using native PTY on each platform.
//! Sessions are managed server-side and stream output to the frontend via Tauri events.

//! # Events
//!
//! - `pty-output-{session_id}`: Emitted when the PTY produces output
//!   (JSON: `{ b64, byte_count, seq }`)
//! - `pty-exit-{session_id}`: Emitted when the PTY session terminates
//!
//! # Session Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. Frontend calls `create_pty` with session ID, dimensions, and optional shell/cwd
//! 2. Backend spawns PTY with shell process and starts output reader task
//! 3. Frontend sends keystrokes via `write_pty`
//! 4. Backend streams output back via `pty-output-{session_id}` events
//! 5. Frontend calls `close_pty` or session ends when shell exits
//!
//! # Platform Support
//!
//! - **macOS/Linux**: Uses `zsh` as default shell with `-il` flags (interactive login)
//! - **Windows**: Uses `powershell.exe` as default shell

/// natural-EOF removal (shell exited, e.g. right after launching a backgrounded
/// `nohup` job) and `close_session` (user closed the tab). In both cases the
/// shell PID vanishes from the map, but HUP-immune descendants in its session
/// keep running until logout. Only the app-exit sweep is contracted to kill
/// them, so the SID must outlive the session.
///
/// Reached from `create_session` — where both creation paths (the user-facing
/// `create_pty` command and the OS-agent path) converge and where neither
/// agent call site has access to `PtyState` — by a single insert, and
/// consumed by `shutdown_kill_all`. PTY cleanup is inherently process-global
/// (one app process owns one set of descendants to sweep), so a static carries
/// no isolation risk that `PtyState`'s Tauri-managed singleton would not.
///
/// Lifetime: entries are added at shell spawn and removed only by the
/// app-exit sweep (`shutdown_kill_all` clears the whole registry). There is
/// intentionally NO `unregister` on natural session removal — removing an
/// entry the moment its shell exits would discard exactly the SID needed to
/// sweep that shell's still-living HUP-immune descendants, reintroducing the
/// leak this registry exists to close. A safe unregister would require
/// proving no live descendants remain, which cannot be done without a
/// process scan at removal time. Entries are 12 bytes each and bounded by
/// the app's lifetime terminal churn, so unbounded growth is not a concern.
///
/// Each entry pairs the PID with the shell's `start_time` (seconds since
/// boot). On app-exit sweep, a registered PID is treated as a sweep candidate
/// only if its current holder either no longer exists (shell dead, PID not
/// reused — its orphaned descendants are safe to sweep) or still has the
/// recorded `start_time` (our shell is still alive). If the PID now exists
/// with a different `start_time`, the OS reused it for an unrelated process
/// and we drop the candidate rather than risk killing the wrong session.
/// This closes the most direct PID-reuse mis-kill path; it is NOT a complete
/// proof — see [`shutdown_kill_all`] for the residual window.
