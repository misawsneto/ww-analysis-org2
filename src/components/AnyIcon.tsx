/**
 * Safe renderer for an icon whose shape is not known at the call site.
 *
 * Most icons in this app are hugeicons glyph data (`IconSvgElement`) rendered
 * directly with `<HugeiconsIcon icon={Search} />`. Those call sites do NOT need
 * this component and should keep using `HugeiconsIcon`.
 *
 * Use `AnyIcon` where the icon arrives dynamically — from a registry lookup, a
 * prop, a ternary, a menu-item model. Three things can show up there:
 *
 *   - hugeicons glyph data            -> rendered via `HugeiconsIcon`
 *   - a hand-authored SVG component   -> brand marks (GitHub, MCP) that no icon
 *                                        set provides
 *   - `""`                            -> the deliberate "no icon here" spelling
 *                                        used by item models (renders nothing)
 *
 * ...and a fourth: nothing at all. `HugeiconsIcon` does `[...icon]` internally,
 * so an `undefined` icon throws
 * "Spread syntax requires ...iterable[Symbol.iterator] to be a function"
 * and takes down the entire render tree — a whole screen lost to one missing
 * icon, with nothing in the message identifying which. `Record` lookups make
 * this easy to hit: `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is off, so `ICONS[key]` is typed
 * as present while returning `undefined` for any key that is not.
 *
 * This component degrades that to a missing icon: it renders `null`, and in dev
 * it warns once with whatever context the caller supplied via `data-icon`.
