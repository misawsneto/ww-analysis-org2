/**
 * Local project-org aliasing for managed-cloud orgs (cloud-parity Phase B).
 *
 * The Rust collab bridge is backend-agnostic: any local `project_orgs` row
 * with `sync_provider='orgii_collab'` routes its project / work-item
 * mutations into the orgii_collab outbox, and `external_org_id` records
 * which REMOTE org drains it. Cloud orgs reuse that exact flag (the TS
 * engine decides which backend the outbox pushes to), so the alias row is
 * the single durable link between a cloud org and its local project data —
 * `org2CloudOrgsAtom` is in-memory only and cannot carry it.
 *
 * `ensureProjectOrgForCloudOrg` mirrors the self-hosted
 * `ensureProjectOrgForCollabOrg` (CreateCollabOrgView) semantics, with one
 * cross-plane guard: a name-matched org is only adopted when it carries NO
 * collab marking at all — neither an `external_org_id` (aliased to a
 * different org) nor `sync_provider='orgii_collab'` without one (a legacy
 * stamp-less self-hosted alias: the Rust pull-path heal sets only the
 * provider flag). Stealing either would drain one outbox into two backends.
 * Conversely, a row WE own (external-id or id match) that is marked but
 * missing `external_org_id` is re-stamped, or `resolveCloudOrgForProjectOrg`
 * could never find it and the cloud plane would sync rows it cannot
 * arbitrate locks / allocate short ids for.
