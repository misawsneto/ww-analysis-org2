/**
 * Bundle-boundary guard for the chat-projection web worker.
 *
 * The worker is its own webpack entrypoint. Any dynamic `import()` reachable
 * from its *static* graph becomes part of the worker's chunk graph; because
 * the worker entry does not share the main app's `vendors` chunk, webpack
 * then has to copy every vendor module those chunks need (react-dom, xterm,
 * CodeMirror, zod, …) into the async chunks the main app also loads. When
 * `ActionRegistry` imported the registry barrel — which re-exports
 * `rendering/registry/events/index.ts` with its lazy renderer loaders — the
 * worker statically reached 2 388 files and the production build carried
 * ~9 MB of duplicated vendor code. See
 * docs/memory-audit-2026-08-16/ram-optimization-findings.md (Fix log, 2.3).
