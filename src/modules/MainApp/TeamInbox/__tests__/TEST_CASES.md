# Test Cases: TeamInbox "Load more" pagination (A1)

Covers the load-more pagination feature wired through
`useTeamInboxDataSource.loadMore` → `TeamInboxView` → `TeamInboxList`.
Behavior is derived from the shipped implementation, not aspirational.

## Preconditions

- Team Inbox tab is open and the connected data source (`ConnectedTeamInboxView`)
  is mounted, or the injectable `TeamInboxView` is rendered with a
  `dataSource` implementing `listPage` (+ optional `loadMore`).
- Local source page size is 50 (`listLocalTeamInboxPage(..., 50)`); cloud
  mentions page size is 50 (`listTeamInboxMentions(..., 50)`).
- `hasMore` is surfaced to the view via `listPage().nextCursor != null`; the
  cursor value itself is an inert sentinel — the per-store coordinator owns the
  real local/cloud cursors shared by Sidebar and full Inbox consumers.
- The load-more control renders whenever `hasMore === true` and `onLoadMore` is
  defined, including filter/search empty-result states.

## Happy Path

| #   | Steps                                                         | Expected Result                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Open inbox with > 50 assigned local items (or > 50 mentions). | First page (≤ 50 per source) renders; "Load more" button is visible at list bottom.                                                                                                              |
| 2   | Click "Load more".                                            | Button shows loading/disabled; next page of each source with a remaining cursor is fetched, appended, de-duplicated (`dedupeTeamInboxItems`), re-sorted by the view selectors; new items appear. |
| 3   | Keep clicking "Load more" until exhausted.                    | Each click appends the next page; when both shared coordinator cursors are null, `hasMore` becomes false and the button disappears.                                                              |
| 4   | Load more with both local + cloud having further pages.       | Both sources advance one page; merged list stays newest-first after the view's `selectTeamInboxItems` (dedupe + sort).                                                                           |
| 5   | After load-more, mark a newly-loaded item read.               | Optimistic read state applies to the appended item exactly as for first-page items.                                                                                                              |

## Edge Cases

| #   | Scenario                                               | Steps                                                              | Expected Result                                                                                                                                      |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Empty first page with a remaining cursor               | Open an active filter/search with 0 visible items and `hasMore`.   | Empty `Placeholder` renders together with "Load more", so a matching later page remains reachable.                                                   |
| 2   | Single page                                            | Open inbox where both sources returned `nextCursor == null`.       | `hasMore === false`; **no** "Load more" button; list is complete.                                                                                    |
| 3   | Exactly one source paginates                           | Local has a next page, cloud does not (or vice versa).             | Button shown while either cursor is non-null; each click advances only the source that still has a cursor; the exhausted source contributes nothing. |
| 4   | Multi-page to exhaustion                               | Click load-more repeatedly.                                        | Cursors advance each call; button hides once both cursors are null; no duplicate rows (dedupe by canonical `kind:id`).                               |
| 5   | Rapid repeated clicks                                  | Click "Load more" several times quickly.                           | View loading state plus the coordinator single-flight promise ensure only one in-flight load; extra clicks reuse/no-op; no duplicated/skipped pages. |
| 6   | Load-more with active search query                     | Type a query, then click "Load more".                              | Load-more fetches more raw items into the cache; the client-side search (`searchTeamInboxItems`) re-applies over the enlarged set.                   |
| 7   | Load-more with a filter tab active (mentions/assigned) | Switch filter, then load more.                                     | Raw items append to the shared cache; the active filter (`selectTeamInboxItems`) still narrows the rendered list.                                    |
| 8   | Duplicate item across pages                            | A canonical item appears in two fetched pages.                     | Deduped to one; the freshest `occurredAt` copy wins (`dedupeTeamInboxItems`).                                                                        |
| 9   | Refresh after paginating                               | Load more, then trigger refresh (manual or project-change signal). | Cursors reset to page 1; `hasMore` recomputed from page-1 cursors; list resets to first page.                                                        |

## Error / Degraded States

| --- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Cloud fetch fails during load-more | Cloud RPC throws while paginating.          | Local page still commits; cloud cursor is preserved for retry; a localized partial-success warning appears.                         |
| 2   | Local fetch fails during load-more | `listLocalTeamInboxPage` rejects.           | Cloud page still commits; local cursor is preserved for retry; a localized partial-success warning appears.                         |
| 3   | Every requested source fails       | Both active source reads reject.            | Existing rows remain; load-more rejects to the view, which shows localized non-blocking error copy and resets loading in `finally`. |
| 4   | Load-more called with no cursors   | `hasMore` stale-true but both cursors null. | `loadMore` early-returns (no-op); no fetch; `loadingMore` never gets stuck.                                                         |
| 5   | Signed-out / no active cloud org   | Only local paginates.                       | No cloud request is started; only local advances.                                                                                   |

## Accessibility

- [ ] "Load more" uses the design-system `Button` (keyboard focusable, Enter/Space activate).
- [ ] While loading, the button is `disabled` and shows `loading` state (no double submit).
- [ ] The button has a visible localized label (`teamInbox.loadMore`) — no raw fallback string or i18n key leaks.
- [ ] Load-more does not steal focus from the list; existing roving-tabindex list navigation is unaffected.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Items beyond the first 50 per source are reachable (no silent truncation) via load-more.
- [ ] `hasMore` accurately reflects "either source has a next page" and the button visibility follows it.
- [ ] Appended pages are de-duplicated and correctly ordered by the view selectors.
- [ ] Concurrent/rapid load-more is guarded (single in-flight request).
- [ ] Either source may fail independently; the successful source still paginates, the failed cursor remains retryable, and loaded items are preserved.
- [ ] Load-more never derives the badge from the loaded window; the server's authoritative mention count remains unchanged until a read mutation succeeds.
- [ ] `pnpm test` for `src/modules/MainApp/TeamInbox` passes; no new TypeScript/lint errors in edited files.

## Notes / Known limitations

- The unread badge uses the cloud RPC's authoritative full-result count, so
  unread mentions on page 2+ are included before those rows are loaded.
- Coordinator behavior is unit-tested at the shared Jotai-store seam for cursor
  continuity, partial failure, scope switching, optimistic rollback and cache
  bounds. Component composition tests cover empty-result pagination and retry.
